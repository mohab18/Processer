# Processer

## 📌 Project Overview
Processer is a simple processor simulation project developed to demonstrate how basic instruction execution and control flow work at a conceptual level.  
The project focuses on understanding how a processor handles operations step by step rather than on hardware-level implementation.

This project was created for **educational purposes** to practice system logic, processing flow, and structured program design.
